//! What went wrong, written down.
//!
//! A released build has no console: `eprintln!` goes nowhere, a panic takes the
//! window with it and leaves the player with nothing to send, and an error in
//! the front end blanks a panel in silence. All three end up here instead.
//!
//! It is a record of trouble, not a trace of everything: warnings, errors and
//! one line a session saying what was started. The optional local-event journal
//! is separate — this one is small enough to paste into a chat, and is kept that
//! way on purpose.
