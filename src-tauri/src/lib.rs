/// Keep WebKitGTK away from the renderer NVIDIA's driver cannot survive.
///
/// Since 2.40 WebKitGTK composites through a DMA-BUF renderer. On the
/// proprietary NVIDIA driver its web process segfaults inside
/// `libnvidia-eglcore` while tearing a GL context down — which from the outside
/// looks like the tray icon arriving and the window never following, with a
/// crash reporter naming `WebKitWebProcess`. Every GTK application in the same
/// position turns the renderer off, and the cost here is a little smoothness on
/// a panel that is mostly still pictures.
///
/// NVIDIA is not the only way it fails, though, and the second way cannot be
/// tested for from here.
///
/// A player on KDE with an AMD card and no NVIDIA module at all got
/// `Could not create default EGL display: EGL_BAD_PARAMETER. Aborting...` four
/// times over and then the same invisible window — through XWayland, with the
/// overlay working and the renderer still unable to find a display to draw on. Whatever the renderer
/// wants there, it does not have, and nothing this process can read says so in
/// advance: the failure happens inside a web process that has not started yet.
///
/// So it is learned instead. Every start leaves `no-paint` behind and `ui_ready`
/// removes it once something has actually been drawn; a start that finds the
/// file knows the run before it drew nothing, and writes `soft-render` to say
/// that this machine does not get the DMA-BUF renderer again. Delete that file
/// to try it once more — after a driver update, say.
///
/// Only machines that need it pay for it, and never one where the user has
/// already made the choice themselves. It has to be set before GTK starts,
/// which is why it lives at the top of `run` — and the process is still
/// single-threaded here, so setting it is safe.
